- [x] Update tool descriptions with enhanced details
- [x] All tools now have proper annotations

## Phase 1: Resources (2-3 days) - HIGH PRIORITY üî•

## Phase 2: Prompts (2 days) - MEDIUM PRIORITY üìù
- [ ] Create prompt templates
  - [ ] `summarize-thread` - Summarize conversations
  - [ ] `draft-reply` - Generate contextual replies
  - [ ] `analyze-sentiment` - Analyze post/thread sentiment
  - [ ] `find-related` - Find related discussions
  - [ ] `generate-hashtags` - Suggest relevant tags
  - [ ] `engagement-report` - Generate analytics
- [ ] Implement `prompts/list` endpoint
  - [ ] Expose available prompts
  - [ ] Include descriptions and examples
- [ ] Implement `prompts/get` endpoint
  - [ ] Return fully rendered prompts
  - [ ] Support context injection

## Phase 5: HTTP Transport (2 days) - MEDIUM PRIORITY üåê
- [ ] Add HTTP server option
  - [ ] REST endpoints with JSON-RPC 2.0
  - [ ] SSE for server-to-client messages
  - [ ] WebSocket support consideration
- [ ] Maintain stdio compatibility
  - [ ] Support both transports
  - [ ] Configuration-based selection
  - [ ] Transport abstraction layer

## Phase 4: Sampling (1-2 days) - LOW PRIORITY üé≤

  - [ ] Summary generation

## Phase 7: Advanced Features (3-4 days) - LOW PRIORITY üöÄ
- [ ] Implement Roots
  - [ ] Define workspace boundaries
  - [ ] Multi-tenant configuration
  - [ ] Operational limits
- [ ] Add Binary Resource Support
  - [ ] Profile images
  - [ ] Media attachments
  - [ ] Export files (CSV, JSON)
  - [ ] Analytics visualizations
- [ ] Request/Response Hooks
  - [ ] Middleware architecture
  - [ ] Custom processing pipeline
  - [ ] Error enrichment

## Additional Recommendations
- [ ] Add input validation at protocol level
- [ ] Implement proper error handling with context
- [ ] Add timeout management
- [ ] Implement request/response logging
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry for observability

## Progress Tracking
- Total items: ~60
- Completed: 6 (Phase 6 complete)
- In Progress: 0
- Remaining: 54

## Notes
- Start with Phase 6 (Tool Annotations) - quickest win
- Prioritize security features before expanding functionality
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to next
- Update documentation as features are added
