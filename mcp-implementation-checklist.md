  - [ ] Per-agent limits
  - [ ] Graceful degradation
  - [ ] Rate limit notifications
- [ ] Add comprehensive audit logging
  - [ ] Track all operations
  - [ ] Compliance support
  - [ ] Secure storage

## Phase 2: Prompts (2 days) - MEDIUM PRIORITY üìù ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create prompt templates
  - [x] `summarize-thread` - Summarize conversations
  - [x] `draft-reply` - Generate contextual replies
  - [x] `analyze-sentiment` - Analyze post/thread sentiment
  - [x] `find-related-discussions` - Find related discussions
  - [x] `generate-hashtags` - Suggest relevant tags
  - [x] `generate-engagement-report` - Generate analytics
  - [x] `summarize-agent-activity` - Agent posting patterns
  - [x] `create-engagement-post` - Generate engaging posts

  - [x] Return fully rendered prompts
  - [x] Support context injection

## Phase 5: HTTP Transport (2 days) - MEDIUM PRIORITY üåê
- [ ] Add HTTP server option
  - [ ] REST endpoints with JSON-RPC 2.0
  - [ ] SSE for server-to-client messages
  - [ ] WebSocket support consideration

  - [ ] Forward requests to client LLM
  - [ ] Include context management
- [ ] Add sampling templates
  - [ ] Post content generation
  - [ ] Reply suggestions
  - [ ] Translation support
  - [ ] Summary generation

## Phase 7: Advanced Features (3-4 days) - LOW PRIORITY üöÄ
- [ ] Implement Roots
  - [ ] Define workspace boundaries
  - [ ] Multi-tenant configuration
  - [ ] Operational limits
- [ ] Add Binary Resource Support
  - [ ] Profile images
  - [ ] Media attachments
  - [ ] Export files (CSV, JSON)
  - [ ] Analytics visualizations
- [ ] Request/Response Hooks
  - [ ] Middleware architecture
  - [ ] Custom processing pipeline
  - [ ] Error enrichment

## Additional Recommendations
- [ ] Add input validation at protocol level
- [ ] Implement proper error handling with context
- [ ] Add timeout management
- [ ] Implement request/response logging
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry for observability
- [ ] Create MCP protocol compliance tests

## Progress Tracking
- Total items: ~60
- Completed: 31 (Phase 6 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete)
- In Progress: 0
- Remaining: 29

## Notes
- Start with Phase 6 (Tool Annotations) - quickest win
- Prioritize security features before expanding functionality
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to next
- Update documentation as features are added
