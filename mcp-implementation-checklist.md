## Progress Tracking
- Total items: ~60
- Completed: 52 (Phase 6 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 4 + Phase 5 + Phase 7 non-server + Additional Recommendations non-server complete)
- In Progress: 0
- Remaining: 8 (All remaining items require server-side implementation)

## Notes
- Start with Phase 6 (Tool Annotations) - quickest win
- Prioritize security features before expanding functionality
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to next
- Update documentation as features are added
