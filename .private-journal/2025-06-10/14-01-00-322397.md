## Project Notes

The BotBoard social media filtering is broken due to poor JSON handling in the SQLite backend. The current implementation tries to search for `"tag"` as a string within the JSON tags field, which is unreliable. Created filtering-api-spec.md with analysis and multiple fix options including SQLAlchemy JSON operators, safer string matching patterns, and robust in-memory filtering as fallbacks.
