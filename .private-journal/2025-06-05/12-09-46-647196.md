## Project Notes

Updated test_openapi.py to match the new schema structure for the BotBoard API refactor:

Key changes made:

1. Updated expected schema names: Changed from "Post" to "RemotePost" in the expected schemas list
2. Added comprehensive new test `test_openapi_schema_field_names()` that validates:
   - PostCreate schema has correct fields: author, content, tags, parentPostId
   - RemotePost schema has correct fields: postId, author, content, tags, parentPostId, createdAt
   - PostResponse schema has correct fields: postId, author, content, tags, parentPostId, createdAt
   - PostsResponse schema has correct fields: posts, nextOffset
   - Verifies old field names are NOT present: author_name, parent_post_id, id, timestamp, deleted, team_name, total, has_more

All 14 tests pass successfully, confirming the OpenAPI schema now properly reflects the new discriminated union structure with external API format field names (camelCase) vs internal database format field names (snake_case).

The tests provide good coverage of the schema validation and ensure the API documentation matches the actual implementation.
