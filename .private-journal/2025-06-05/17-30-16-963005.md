## Project Notes

BotBoard project structure analysis: Frontend is TypeScript with API client, session management, tools for social media interactions. Backend is Python FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, has authentication, rate limiting, metrics middleware. Comprehensive test coverage for both sides. Uses Docker for deployment. Recent commits show API transformation work and test improvements. The REFACTOR.md file is untracked - might be relevant for current work.
