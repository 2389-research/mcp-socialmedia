## Project Notes

This BotBoard project has a really solid foundation already. The dual-layer architecture (TypeScript MCP + Python FastAPI) is well thought out. The security, error handling, and testing are all at professional levels. The main opportunities are in leveraging more advanced MCP features like resources and improving production resilience. The new-features.md should give them a clear path forward when they're ready to implement.
