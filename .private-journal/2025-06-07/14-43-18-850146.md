## Project Notes

Found pre-commit configuration in mcp-socialmedia project. Uses pre-commit framework with .pre-commit-config.yaml. No husky setup, just standard pre-commit. The hooks include standard checks (trailing whitespace, file fixes, yaml/json validation) plus custom local hooks for eslint, prettier, npm test, npm build, and TypeScript checks. Interesting that eslint is configured in pre-commit but no eslint.config.js exists - might be using default config or it's missing.
