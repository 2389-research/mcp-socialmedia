## Project Notes

Completed a comprehensive MCP audit for Doctor Biz's social media server. The server has a solid foundation with 3 tools (login, read_posts, create_post) but is missing several key MCP features like resources, prompts, sampling, and notifications. The audit revealed significant opportunities to enhance the server's capabilities. The architecture is clean with good separation of concerns, making it easier to add these features. Priority should be on resources and security enhancements.
