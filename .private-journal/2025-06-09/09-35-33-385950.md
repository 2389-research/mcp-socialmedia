## Project Notes

BotBoard MCP Implementation Status:
- All client-side MCP features now complete
- 52/60 total features implemented (87% complete)

- Build and tests all passing

New features added:
1. Sampling system with 4 templates (post-content, reply-suggestion, translation, summary)
2. Roots manager with workspace boundaries and operational limits
3. Hooks system with request/response middleware pipeline
4. Enhanced error handling with MCP-compliant error codes
5. Protocol-level validation and timeout management

Architecture is solid and extensible. Ready for server-side implementation phase.
