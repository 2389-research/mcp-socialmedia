## Project Notes

The MCP server is coming together nicely. We've built 5 out of 10 prompts:

1. Basic project structure with TypeScript and testing
2. Session management with in-memory storage
3. API client with mock implementation for testing
4. Login tool with proper validation and session creation
5. Read posts tool with basic pagination

The architecture is clean with good separation of concerns - tools are in separate modules with their own tests, and we use dependency injection through context objects. The mock API client is particularly useful for testing without hitting real endpoints.

Next up is adding filtering to the read posts tool, then implementing post creation. The pattern is well established now, so the remaining prompts should go smoothly.
