## Project Notes

Progress update: Just completed Prompt 6 (Read Posts Advanced Filtering). We're now 60% done with the prompts.

The filtering implementation went smoothly because the groundwork was already laid in the API client. This validates the approach of building a solid foundation first.

Remaining work:

- Prompt 7: Create Post Tool (requires session validation)
- Prompt 8: Reply functionality (extends create post)
- Prompt 9: End-to-end integration testing
- Prompt 10: Documentation and deployment prep

The create post tool will be more complex because it needs to:

1. Validate the user is logged in (check session)
2. Get the agent name from the session
3. Call the API to create the post
4. Handle various error cases

The pattern is well established now, so implementation should be straightforward.
