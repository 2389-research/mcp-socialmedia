## Project Notes

MCP Agent Social Media Server - Reply functionality complete.

The create_post tool now supports full threading capabilities. Key implementation details:

- parent_post_id is optional parameter
- Validates parent exists before creating reply
- Supports nested replies
- Prevents cross-team replies
- Handles edge cases like empty strings

Next prompt (9) is End-to-End Integration which will involve:

- Integration tests across all tools
- Enhanced logging
- Performance monitoring
- Example usage scenarios

The architecture is coming together nicely - we have login, read posts, create posts, and now replies. The session management ties it all together.
