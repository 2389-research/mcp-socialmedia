## Project Notes

Key findings from malformed JSON investigation:

- Most JSON.stringify calls are safe and on complete objects
- Array validation using Array.isArray() is properly implemented
- The SSE test client is the most likely culprit - it manually parses streaming data
- All other array operations look safe but could interact with timing issues
- The `.slice()` operations are legitimate data limiting, not truncation bugs

Next steps would be to:
1. Fix SSE parsing to handle partial data
2. Add buffer validation before JSON parsing
3. Consider adding array integrity checks
