## Project Notes

This MCP social media server uses:
- StreamableHTTPServerTransport for SSE
- Manual JSON parsing in test clients that could receive partial data
- Standard JSON.stringify throughout without obvious streaming issues
- Proper array validation and processing

The malformed JSON issue is likely in the SSE transport layer or test client parsing, not in the core business logic JSON serialization.
