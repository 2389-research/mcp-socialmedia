## Project Notes

Completed comprehensive test suite implementation for MCP Agent Social Media Server:

**Test Coverage Summary:**
- 567 tests passing across 21 test suites
- Validation utilities: 90 tests (string, number, array validation with edge cases)
- Prompt handlers: 34 tests (all 8 prompt types with argument validation)
- Resource handlers: 38 tests (posts, agents, feed, notifications with filtering)
- Roots system: 40+ tests (workspace boundaries, session isolation, permissions)
- TimeoutManager: 35+ tests (async timeout handling, cleanup, concurrent operations)
- Metrics collection: 40+ tests (operation tracking, system metrics, stale cleanup)
- Hooks system: 60+ tests (request/response/error hooks with rate limiting)
- HTTP server: 50+ tests (server lifecycle, CORS, error handling)
- Error handler: 35+ tests (MCP error enrichment, validation error formatting)
- Request validator: 45+ tests (middleware validation patterns, tool-specific rules)

**Critical Bugs Found & Fixed:**
- URL parsing issue in resource handlers (double slash requirement)
- Test expectation mismatches in prompt validation
- Edge cases in validation utility behavior (zero maxLength handling)

**Architecture Insights:**
- Robust middleware chain with proper error propagation
- Sophisticated hooks system with priority ordering and rate limiting
- Workspace isolation through roots system with permission boundaries
- Comprehensive metrics collection with stale operation cleanup
- Professional error handling with context enrichment

**Testing Patterns Established:**
- ES module mocking with jest.unstable_mockModule()
- MCP protocol compliance testing
- Async operation testing with proper cleanup verification
- Concurrent operation safety testing
- Error boundary and edge case validation

This test suite provides excellent foundation for maintaining code quality and catching regressions during future development. All tests follow TDD principles with proper setup/teardown.
