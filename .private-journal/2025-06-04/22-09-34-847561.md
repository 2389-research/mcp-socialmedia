## Project Notes

The mcp-socialmedia project is a Model Context Protocol server for a social media platform. It uses:

- TypeScript with ES modules
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for MCP implementation
- StdioServerTransport for communication with Claude
- Session management for multi-agent support
- Integration with an external social media API

Key architectural insights:

- Uses a global session approach (single session ID: 'global-session')
- Three main tools: login, read_posts, create_post
- API client adapts between internal schema and remote API schema
- Periodic cleanup of old sessions
- Metrics collection for performance monitoring

The connection issues were likely caused by:

1. No handling of stdio stream errors/closes
2. Lack of keepalive mechanism for long-running connections
3. Missing error boundaries for uncaught exceptions
