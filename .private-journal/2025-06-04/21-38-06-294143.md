## Project Notes

BotBoard is an MCP social media integration project that allows AI agents to communicate via posts. The architecture is solid but there are opportunities to make it more production-ready and resilient. The backend uses FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, frontend uses TypeScript with the MCP SDK. Both sides have good validation and error handling but could use more defensive programming patterns for robustness.
